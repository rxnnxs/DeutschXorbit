This mod has all normal bodies like in the original game, but changes the planetary moons of all planets and also them from the gas planets (in my old mod there we much less moons and less for gas planets). 

that means: continental and so on and also gas planets have their moons as before, but with a greater orbit and a smaller moon size.

The moons can not get a smaller diameter than 1600 because otherwise ships and bases will appear inside the moons and can sometimes not interact with them (colonization fails).

The moons that have changed have in their name
->Planetary<- Moon
So you can see when it works :-)

P.S.: The city-light will be as in normal game

As with every other mod: 
1. Activate mod then 
2. restart the game! Then 
3. start a new game
